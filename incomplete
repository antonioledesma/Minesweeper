{- Still to do:

1) write a function that gives random locations for mines (given size of board and number
   of desired mines)

2) write a function that, given the random locations of the mines, creates a
   "data" board (or infoBoard)

3) write the play function, which will first determine whether the move is valid
   (i.e. within the bounds of the board, if the cell hasn't already been opened,
   and whether or not the cell contains a mine or not), and if it is, make the move
   and return the corresponding "show" board. If not, game over
       a) this function will be recursive: as long as a mine isn't hit, make the move
          and pass the resulting "show" board into the play function for the next move
